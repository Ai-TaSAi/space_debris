## Asset credits:
- Music : Serge Pavkin Music

- Seismic Charge Sound Effect : Star Wars Seismic Charge
- Art : Original

Rough time for completion: 4.5 hours

## Updated Changes:
- Faucet & Sink : Repurposed score tracker to serve as a point faucet. Sink is the seismic charge the player can activate using spacebar.
- Hard Gate: Point deadline every 30 seconds. Usually passable, but will instantly kill the player if they fail to reach it.
- Soft Gate: Progressive difficulty: Player, if skilled, or lucky enough, won't have to worry about difficulty, but will have to spend points to clear the screen.
